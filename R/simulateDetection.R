#' Simulate Detection Histories Conditional on Occupancy and Sampling
#'
#' This function simulates detection/non-detection data over multiple visits per year,
#' conditional on both true occupancy and visit occurrence (i.e., whether a site was sampled).
#' Detection probability is defined by a logistic function of a site-level covariate.
#'
#' @param Y A matrix of true occupancy states for each site and year, with dimensions \code{[nSites, nYears]}.
#' @param S A 3D array of sampling events with dimensions \code{[nSites, nYears, nVisits]}.
#' Each element \code{S[i, t, v]} should be 1 if a visit occurred and 0 otherwise.
#' @param w Numeric vector. A site-level covariate influencing detection probability. Must be of length equal to the number of sites.
#' @param alpha_p Numeric. Intercept on the logit scale for detection probability.
#' @param beta_p Numeric. Slope on the logit scale for the effect of \code{w} on detection probability.
#'
#' @return A 3D array of detection outcomes \code{D[i, t, v]}, where each element is:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item 1 if a species was detected (i.e., site was sampled, species was present, and detected)
#'   \item 0 if site was sampled but species was either absent or not detected
#'   \item 0 if no visit occurred (i.e., \code{S[i, t, v] = 0})
#' }
