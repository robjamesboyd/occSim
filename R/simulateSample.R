#' Simulate Sampling Visits Across Sites and Years
#'
#' This function simulates whether a site is sampled on each of several visits per year,
#' with sampling probability determined by a logistic function of a site-level explanatory variable.
#' The number of sites and years is inferred from the dimensions of a provided occupancy matrix.
#'
#' @param Y A matrix of true occupancy states for each site and year, with dimensions \code{nSites Ã— nYears}.
#' This is used to determine the number of sites and years to simulate.
#' @param nVisits Integer. The number of sampling visits per year (assumed to be the same for all site-year combinations).
#' @param z Numeric vector. A site-level covariate influencing the probability of being sampled on each visit.
#' Must be of length equal to the number of rows (sites) in \code{Y}.
#' @param alpha_psi Numeric. The intercept on the logit scale for the sampling probability.
#' @param beta_psi Numeric. The slope on the logit scale for the effect of the covariate \code{z} on the sampling probability.
#'
#' @return A 3-dimensional array of sampling states with dimensions \code{[nSites, nYears, nVisits]}.
#' Each element \code{S[i, t, v]} is a binary indicator equal to 1 if site \code{i} was sampled on visit \code{v} in year \code{t}, and 0 otherwise.
