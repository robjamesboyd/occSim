\title{Simulate Sampling Visits Across Sites and Years}
\usage{
simulateSample(Y, nVisits, z, alpha_psi, beta_psi, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Matrix \link{nSites x nYears} of true occupancy states.}

\item{nVisits}{Integer. Number of visit occasions per year.}

\item{z}{Numeric vector. Site-level covariate for sampling probability.}

\item{alpha_psi, }{beta_psi Numeric. Intercept and slope for sampling probability (on logit scale).}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, display 3 time-series. Panel 1 is occupancy at sampled (at least once) vs. all sites;
panel 2 is the sampling fraction (number of sampled sites / total number of sites); and panel 3 is correlation
between sample inclusion (1/0) and occupancy (1/0), or the 'data defect correlation'.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item \code{S}: Sampling array \link{nSites x nYears x nVisits}
\item \code{sampled_once}: Matrix \link{nSites x nYears}, 1 if sampled at least once
\item \code{summary_df}: Data frame with one row per year:
\code{Year, sampling_fraction, mean_occ_all, mean_occ_sampled, data_defect}
}
}
\description{
This function simulates whether a site is sampled on each of several visits per year,
with sampling probability determined by a logistic function of a site-level explanatory variable.
It returns:
\itemize{
\item The 3D sampling array,
\item A matrix indicating whether each site was sampled at least once per year,
\item A 3-panel plot comparing occupancy, sampling fraction, and sampling-occupancy correlation.
}
