\title{Simulate Sampling Process for Occupancy Data}
\usage{
simulateSample(occ, beta0, beta, explanatoryVar)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ}{Output of simulateOccupancy. A list containing at least one element named 'simulated_data', which should be a matrix where
each entry denotes occupancy (1 = occupied, 0 = not occupied) for each site across several years.}

\item{beta0}{Intercept (scalar) for the logistic regression model used to calculate sampling probabilities.}

\item{beta}{Coefficient (scalar) for the logistic regression model associated with the explanatory variable.}

\item{explanatoryVar}{A numeric vector or scalar of the explanatory variable used in logistic regression,
matching the number of rows in \code{occ$simulated_data}.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{summary}: A dataframe with columns \code{year}, \code{real}, and \code{obs} representing the year, the mean real occupancy,
and the mean observed occupancy, respectively.
\item \code{data}: A matrix of observed occupancy values (1 or NA) matching the structure of the input \code{occ$simulated_data}.
\item \code{sample_inclusion}: A matrix indicating whether a site was sampled (1) or not (0) across all years.
}
}
\description{
This function simulates the sampling process for a given occupancy dataset over multiple years and sites,
based on logistic regression parameters. It applies logistic regression to predict sampling probabilities
using an explanatory variable. It returns a list that includes a dataframe summarizing the real and observed
occupancy rates per year, the matrix of observed occupancy data, and a matrix indicating whether each site
was sampled each year.

\examples{
# Assuming 'occ' is a list with a matrix of simulated data
nYears <- 10
nSites <- 5
simulated_data <- matrix(rbinom(nYears * nSites, 1, 0.5), nrow = nYears)
occ <- list(simulated_data = simulated_data)
beta0 <- 0.5
beta <- -0.3
explanatoryVar <- runif(nYears)

results <- simulateSample(occ, beta0, beta, explanatoryVar)
print(results$summary)
